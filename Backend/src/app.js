//Basic configs of express
app.use(express.json({ limit: "50mb" })); //--> expecting json data from users, including base64 images

// also i want through url i want to accept data
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "50mb" }));
//the extended : true means we can accept nested objects,means the data which is coming through url can be nested objects

//also i want to serve static files from public folder,these part of app should be allowed publically viewable

app.use(express.static("public"));
//now the whole public folder is available now we can serve images through it



//configarations for CORS
//through cors i want to tell where my frontend lies
